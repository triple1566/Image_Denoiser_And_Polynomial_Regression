Polynomial Regression Algorithm

A Python implementation of polynomial regression for modeling and predicting non-linear relationships between variables. This project demonstrates the process of fitting a polynomial curve to a set of data points, providing a powerful tool for curve fitting and predictive analysis.

Features
	•	Polynomial regression implemented from scratch.
	•	Ability to choose the degree of the polynomial.
	•	Uses NumPy for efficient matrix operations and mathematical computations.
	•	Visualizes the fitted polynomial curve alongside the input data.

Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polynomial-regression.git
cd polynomial-regression

Then, install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib (for visualization)

If you don’t have them, install using:

pip install numpy matplotlib

Usage

The primary function of this project is to perform polynomial regression on a given dataset. Below is an example of how to use the algorithm.

Example:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from polynomial_regression import PolynomialRegression

# Sample data points (X: feature, Y: target)
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
Y = np.array([1, 4, 9, 16, 25])

# Instantiate the PolynomialRegression model
degree = 2  # Degree of the polynomial
model = PolynomialRegression(degree)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X, Y)

# Predict the values
Y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Plotting the data and the polynomial fit
plt.scatter(X, Y, color='red', label='Data points')
plt.plot(X, Y_pred, label=f'Polynomial Fit (degree={degree})')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Methods:
	•	fit(X, Y): Fits the polynomial regression model to the given data.
	•	predict(X): Predicts the target variable Y based on input X using the fitted polynomial model.

Results

This project provides a visual output of the fitted polynomial curve. The plot below shows the polynomial fit to the sample dataset of X vs Y.
